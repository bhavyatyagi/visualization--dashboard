## Introduction [PLEASE NOTE CHANGE IN DEPLOYMENT URL]
### The app is now deployed at http://bhavya-dashboard.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/
This project is developed using Python, Dash, and Plotly. This gives Vehicle Loan Analytics using the dataset LoanPricing.csv available in this repository. The gender option triggers the callback to serve visualization in accordance with the selected option. I hope you guys like it :).

4. Type: 

        python3 app.py
        
5. The program will run
6. If it asks for missing libraries then do:

    OR      

        pip install dash pandas plotly
    Note: pip3 instead of pip if in case shows command not found.
